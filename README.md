# Production-Line-Prototype-Assembly-Module-
This C code implements algorithm for Assembly Module that is a single stage out of 4 stages in a production line prototype. Microcontroller used is Arduino UNO.

The following components are used:

1- Stepper Motor, NEMA 17.

2- IR Sensor.

3- Limit Switch.

4- Solenoid Valve.

All the following components are programmed to work in a parallel and coherent manner.

N.B.
*Make sure to have stepper motor library installed in your Library Manager*.
